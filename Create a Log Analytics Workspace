Lab 08: Create a Log Analytics Workspace, Azure Storage Account, and Data Collection Rule (DCR)
Student lab manual
Lab scenario
As an Azure Security Engineer for a financial technology company, you are tasked with enhancing monitoring and security visibility across all Azure virtual machines (VMs) used for processing financial transactions and managing sensitive customer data. The security team requires detailed logs and performance metrics from these VMs to detect potential threats and optimize system performance. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has asked you to implement a solution that collects security events, system logs, and performance counters. You have been assigned to configure the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) along with Data Collection Rules (DCRs) to centralize log collection and performance monitoring.

For all the resources in this lab, we are using the East US region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class.

Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:

Exercise 1: Deploy an Azure virtual machine
Exercise 2: Create a Log Analytics workspace
Exercise 3: Create an Azure storage account
Exercise 4: Create a data colllection rule
Instructions
Exercise 1: Deploy an Azure virtual machine
Exercise timing: 10 minutes
In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

Task 1: Deploy an Azure virtual machine.
Task 1: Deploy an Azure virtual machine
Sign-in to the Azure portal https://portal.azure.com/.

Note: Sign in to the Azure portal using an account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, select PowerShell and Create storage.

Ensure PowerShell is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a resource group that will be used in this lab:

code
 New-AzResourceGroup -Name AZ500LAB131415 -Location 'EastUS'
Note: This resource group will be used for labs 8, 9, and 10.

In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to enable encryption at host (EAH)

code
 Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName "EncryptionAtHost" -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute 
In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure virtual machine.

code
 New-AzVm -ResourceGroupName "AZ500LAB131415" -Name "myVM" -Location 'EastUS' -VirtualNetworkName "myVnet" -SubnetName "mySubnet" -SecurityGroupName   "myNetworkSecurityGroup" -PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIpAddress" -PublicIpSku Standard -OpenPorts 80,3389 -Size Standard_DS1_v2 
When prompted for credentials:

Setting	Value
User	localadmin
Password	Please use your personal password created in Lab 02 > Exercise 2 > Task 1 > Step 3.
Note: Wait for the deployment to complete.

In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to confirm that the virtual machine named myVM was created and its ProvisioningState is Succeeded.

code
 Get-AzVM -Name 'myVM' -ResourceGroupName 'AZ500LAB131415' | Format-Table
Close the Cloud Shell pane.

Exercise 2: Create an Log Analytics workspace
Exercise timing: 10 minutes
In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:
